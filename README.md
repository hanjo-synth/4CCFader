# **4CCFader**

**4CCFader** is a real-time **MIDI CC morphing tool** for Monome Norns, designed for expressive live control and sound design.  
Crossfade between two programmable MIDI CC patches and interpolate smoothly using a virtual fader. Perfect for hardware synths, modular rigs, or any MIDI-capable device.

## **USE CASES**

- Morph between two synth presets during a performance  
- Live interpolate between filtered and unfiltered sounds  
- Create expressive motion between modulation states or FX levels  
- Use with modular systems via MIDI-CV interfaces

---

## **REQUIREMENTS**

- **Monome Norns** (any model)  
- Any hardware or software device that responds to **MIDI CC**

---

## **INSTALLATION**

1. Clone or download this repository into your `dust/code/` folder on your Norns.
2. Launch `4CCFader` from the SELECT menu.
